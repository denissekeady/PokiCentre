## 💫 About This Project
Hello! This site is all about teaming up, playing Pokémon Unite, and leaving reviews for your teammates. Here's how it works:
- **Two user types:** Players and Coaches.
- **Class-based system:** Players and coaches are enrolled in classes sorted by Pokémon types and difficulty levels.  
- **Coaches’ role:** Creating teams and managing players.  
- **Players’ role:** Battling and leaving reviews for teammates.
- **Shop:** Purchase a Pokémon companion and accessorise and evolve it!
Each player and coach is enrolled in classes, which are sorted by Pokémon types and difficulty levels. So whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, there’s a class for everyone to level up their game!

### ⭐ **Ranking Reviews**
To encourage players to write useful reviews, I have created a ranking system. Once a player recieves all their reviews for that specific game, they need to assess each review received and rank them from highest to lowest. Rankings turn into points, and points let you shop for cool stuff. Pro tip: Rank #1 gets the most points, so aim high!

- Use points to buy Pokémon! Each Pokémon has:
  - Unique backgrounds.
  - Personalized dialogues.
- Purchase accessories to customize your Pokémon.

### 🐾 **Pokémon Companion**
Your Pokémon isn’t just for show—it’s your cute little companion, hanging out at the bottom right of the page. It even has its own homepage where it "lives." As your Pokémon evolves, its dialogue changes, and it grows alongside you.
